A command-line student management system built with C++, featuring robust class and student record management with object-oriented design principles and modern C++17 features.

## üìã Project Overview

The Student Grade Manager System is a console-based application that provides comprehensive management capabilities for educational settings. Built with C++17, this system demonstrates practical implementation of object-oriented programming, encapsulation, and data structure management. The application enables users to create and manage multiple classes, track student records, maintain grades, and perform CRUD operations through an intuitive menu-driven interface.

## üéØ Purpose

This project was developed to:

- Master C++ object-oriented programming principles and class design
- Implement proper encapsulation with private/public access modifiers
- Practice data structure management using STL containers (vectors)
- Learn modern C++17 features (auto keyword, range-based loops, lambdas)
- Understand exception handling and input validation techniques
- Design clean interfaces for complex data relationships
- Build a practical CLI tool with robust menu navigation
- Explore architectural patterns for managing related entities

The Student Grade Manager serves as both a learning project for C++ development and a functional tool for educational record management.
